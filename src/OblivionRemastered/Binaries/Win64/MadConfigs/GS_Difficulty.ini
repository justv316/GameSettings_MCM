[DifficultyDamageMultiplier]
Description=The difficulty slider affects how much damage the player does in combat, and how much damage they receive. Damage of all types, magical and mundane, is affected by the slider. This multiplier is the maximum amount the damage the player can do if the slider is set all the way to easy. It divides the amount of damage done to the player by the same value. If the slider is set all the way to hard, these values are inverted. This multiplier is reduced when the slider is set to in between values. The difficulty slider can be made more subtle by lowering this value, and more extreme by raising it.
